##🔢 MNIST Classification
This project implements and compares multiple machine learning algorithms for handwritten digit classification using the MNIST dataset.
#Dataset: MNIST handwritten digits
#Task: Multi-class classification (digits 0–9)
#Approaches: Traditional ML models, PCA-based dimensionality reduction, and gradient boosting
#Results: KNN and XGBoost with PCA achieved the highest accuracies (≈ 92–93%), with KNN being more time-efficient
